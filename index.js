const welcomeMessage = `
 Welcome to Gabriel Barth's typescript and javascript handbook. 
 Here I have taken some notes about code. 
 \n You can choose a javascript file to execute using node to take a look.
 Just type it: node javacript/<chosen-file-name> 
 \n In case of typescript, remember to turn it into Javascript before.
 Run: npx tsc
 Then just choose a file: node typescript/dist/<chosen-file-name>
 \n\n I hope you enjouy it :D.
